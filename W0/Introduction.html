      <p> 
Owen’s Rescue Game is an interactive experience that blends storytelling, puzzles, and symbolic meaning. Through a series of mini-games, visitors help Owen, a bear character, escape danger, restore his face, and find the right medicine. The project is part of the IMA Summer ‘25 Show & Tell, created by X+0 Studio. It aims to raise awareness of everyday habitual stereotypes, encouraging players to break stereotypes and avoid bias. </p>
